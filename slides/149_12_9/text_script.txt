we start out in invalid state

and we issue a process to read
and this results in a bus read
it says
get me the cash line
because i want to read it
so that means that the line has to move from invalid to shared

and then if the application then does a write

to that address

which is contained in the cash line
then it's going to issue a process to read

and the result on the bus is a bus read exclusive

and so bus read exclusive says
hey now i need to move the state of the cash line from shared to modified
and modified means that of course

that this is the only cash line in the system that is in modified state
