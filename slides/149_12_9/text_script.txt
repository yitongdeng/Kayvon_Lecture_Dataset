we start out in invalid state
^102 x 101 @ (959, 808).

and we issue a process to read
and this results in a bus read
^126 x 21 @ (842, 745).

it says
get me the cash line
because i want to read it
^126 x 21 @ (842, 745).

so that means that the line has to move
^.

from invalid 
^102 x 101 @ (959, 808).

to shared
^102 x 100 @ (956, 623).

and then if the application then does a write
to that address
which is contained in the cash line
^.

then it's going to issue a process to write
and the result on the bus is a bus read exclusive
^139 x 20 @ (839, 578).

and so bus read exclusive says
hey now i need to move the state of the cash line
^139 x 20 @ (839, 578). 

from shared 
^102 x 100 @ (956, 623).

to modified
and modified means that of course
that this is the only cash line in the system that is in modified state
^102 x 100 @ (943, 451).
