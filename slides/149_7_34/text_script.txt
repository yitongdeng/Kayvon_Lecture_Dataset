every thread block has an address space that only those threads can access

and every thread has its own local address space
like its own local stack that only it can access

so you know local variables to a thread can only be accessed by the thread that makes sense
that's like ispc

but now there's like per thread block variables

which are kind of like uniform variables in istc actually but there's per thread block variables
and then there's overall device global memory that can be accessed by any thread with loads and stores
