every thread block has an address space that only those threads can access
^227 x 170 @ (616, 250).

and every thread has its own local address space
like its own local stack that only it can access
^227 x 75 @ (616, 458).

so you know local variables to a thread can only be accessed by the thread that makes sense
that's like ispc
^227 x 75 @ (616, 458).

but now there's like per thread block variables
^227 x 170 @ (616, 250).

which are kind of like uniform variables in ispc actually but there's per thread block variables
^227 x 170 @ (616, 250).

and then there's overall device global memory that can be accessed by any thread with loads and stores
^229 x 859 @ (1577, 238).
