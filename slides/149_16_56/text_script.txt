but of course it creates a more difficult programming paradigm
right we've already seen that
^.

you need multiple threads for the cpu cores
^224 x 368 @ (510, 366).

you need some data parallel programming model like cuda for the gpu
^219 x 368 @ (272, 366).

and you might need a different programming model for the media components
^101 x 368 @ (750, 365).
