so if you think about this box here as the cpu or the core
^854 x 462 @ (362, 663).

you've got a processor core in there
for example the intel chips that you ran on have four cores in myth
^814 x 104 @ (382, 932).

they had a i'm forgetting now what they had on aws i think we gave you eight core machines with 16 virtual
two hyperthreads per core
^814 x 104 @ (382, 932).

and then there's some caches
and on this diagram
i'm only drawing one of them i'm drawing what's called the last level cache so if you have like an l1 l2 and l3
your l3 is your last level cache
^816 x 106 @ (380, 806).

or if you just have an l1 well your l1's the last level cache we often like to think about the last level cache because that's the point in which memory requests that don't hit the cache 
^816 x 106 @ (380, 806).

now have to go out to memory
^530 x 334 @ (523, 181).

and then there's a box on any modern processor that's called the memory controller
and the memory controller is responsible for 
^811 x 106 @ (383, 678).

when the last level cache takes a cache miss
^816 x 106 @ (380, 806).

the processor has to go get the data from memory
^530 x 334 @ (523, 181).

and the memory controller is responsible for making that request 
^811 x 106 @ (383, 678).

out to memory and then grabbing the results when they come back 
^530 x 334 @ (523, 181).

and making sure the data gets into the appropriate cache and things like that 
^816 x 106 @ (380, 806).

so that's what we're talking about
^.

so where we're gonna go is we're gonna talk about the implementation of memory now as memory as dram
^530 x 334 @ (523, 181).
