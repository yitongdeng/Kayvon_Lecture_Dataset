so if i tell you memory
many of you might say the word dram
or remember a big stick of memory that you might have shoved into a laptop at some time or something like that
^130 x 388 @ (1712, 586).

and so what a dram chip does is it provides it's the implementation of this abstraction
^1105 x 821 @ (748, 363).

you send that dram chip a command that says
give me the value that's stored at address hex b
and this memory chip will send 255 back
^395 x 39 @ (1300, 843).

but we talked about last time how it could take a while to go get that message out there to memory and come back
^.

and so all modern systems have some form of a cache
and this cache is another form of storage that's part of the implementation of memory
^385 x 175 @ (780, 816).

but if the processor says i need address four
well that value might be stored in cache and it can get the answer much
much faster
^385 x 28 @ (780, 923).
