so if i tell you memory
many of you might say the word dram
or remember a big stick of memory that you might have shoved into a laptop at some time or something like that

and so what a dram chip does is it provides it's the implementation of this abstraction

you send that dram chip a command that says
give me the value that's stored at address hex b

and this memory chip will send 255 back

but we talked about last time how it could take a while to go get that message out there to memory and come back

and so all modern systems have some form of a cache

and this cache is another form of storage that's part of the implementation of memory

but if the processor says i need address four

well that value might be stored in cache and it can get the answer much
much faster
