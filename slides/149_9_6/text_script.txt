you've got hundreds of racks of computers

and each of the racks is organized in the following way at the top of the rack you've got this top of rack switch
which is the networking interface to the rest of the racks in the system

and then within the rack
you've got a stack of computer servers
and you can have 20 to 40 servers

and how many servers you can fit in the rack is really dependent on the amount of power that you can actually deliver to the rack
and that will be dependent on what infrastructure you've built in the data center
so that could range from 12 to 20 kilowatts

and if these racks
today if you're in the ml regime and they have gpus in them
then of course the number of computers you can fit in the rack is dramatically lower

because gpus take a lot more power

so then the way to think about it then is
ok so within the rack

you've got the nodes or servers are connected today between 1 to 2 gigabytes of bandwidth

and then between the racks
so outside the racks
early on it was maybe a tenth of a gigabyte

today it might go up to 2 gigabytes
so let's look at what an individual node looks like so you've seen this picture before in the sense that you've got maybe a two socket system which means two cpu chips
each of those chips could contain 16 to 32 cpu cores

and then they're connected to ddr chips which provide the main memory
and you might have 128 to 2 terabytes of dram
main memory
and the bandwidth channel between them is roughly 100 to 200 gigabytes per second
and then from the i o point of view
then you've got i o
which is to storage
which is solid state disk

which would give you 10 to 30 terabytes of storage
and then the other i o interfaces to the network
