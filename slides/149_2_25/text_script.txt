i made that diagram that i had on the last slide just a little bit fancier

i said
look you had this out of order execution logic
^667 x 79 @ (1008, 701).

outside of this class there's all this other fun stuff that's in a processor to make an instruction stream go faster
a lot of it's about not accessing memory
^667 x 630 @ (1008, 356).

like you might put a big old data cache that has a ton of transistors to hold a bunch of data on cache
^667 x 312 @ (1008, 356).

you might actually have logic that predicts what memory you're going to access in the future as a prefetcher
^667 x 77 @ (1008, 907).

they had all this fancy stuff in there to try and make the inner loop go as fast as possible
^667 x 630 @ (1008, 356).

but there's this outer loop that's trivial in a parallel
