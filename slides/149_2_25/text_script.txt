i made that diagram that i had on the last slide just a little bit fancier

i said
look you had this out of order execution logic

outside of this class there's all this other fun stuff that's in a processor to make an instruction stream go faster
a lot of it's about not accessing memory
like you might put a big old data cache that has a ton of transistors to hold a bunch of data on cache
you might actually have logic that predicts what memory you're going to access in the future as a prefetcher
they had all this fancy stuff in there to try and make the inner loop go as fast as possible

but there's this outer loop that's trivial in a parallel
