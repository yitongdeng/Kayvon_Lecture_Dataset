if i take a standard intel cpu these days 
^882 x 582 @ (188, 318).

it has a couple of cores
^322 x 539 @ (369, 361).

there's a gpu on the same thing
^351 x 539 @ (716, 361).

there's a network on this chip that connects all those cores
^557 x 387 @ (1308, 505).

and gets them all out to the same memory system
^379 x 115 @ (1303, 346).

and these networks can be quite complex
^557 x 387 @ (1308, 505).
