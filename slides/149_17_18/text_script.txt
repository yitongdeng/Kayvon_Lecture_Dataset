so you can imagine that if you can get the performance you need with a cpu
hey just go do it and program your application using a high level language
if you need more performance
then you keep going to the right
gpus you may have to write some cuda

dsp
you might have to do assembly language programming

domain specific compute
well this might work quite well if your domain is something like machine learning
and you can program this accelerator using a framework like pytorch or tensorflow
that might work
if you have to do an fpga
then you basically have to become a hardware designer

and asic is

yeah definitely you're a hardware designer
so as you move to the right
you get more energy efficiency

dramatically more energy efficient if you do an asic
but then you have to work much harder
and you've got to spend a lot more money
