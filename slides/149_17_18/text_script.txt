so you can imagine that 
^.

if you can get the performance you need with a cpu
hey just go do it and program your application using a high level language
^193 x 164 @ (105, 446).

if you need more performance
then you keep going to the right
^.

gpus you may have to write some cuda
^188 x 202 @ (342, 416).

dsp
you might have to do assembly language programming
^167 x 79 @ (565, 448).

domain specific compute
well this might work quite well if your domain is something like machine learning
and you can program this accelerator using a framework like pytorch or tensor-flow
that might work
^141 x 212 @ (756, 413).

if you have to do an fpga
then you basically have to become a hardware designer
^175 x 177 @ (983, 421).

and asic is
yeah definitely you're a hardware designer
^192 x 140 @ (1207, 445).

so as you move to the right
you get more energy efficiency
^.

dramatically more energy efficient if you do an asic
^192 x 140 @ (1207, 445).

but then you have to work much harder
and you've got to spend a lot more money
^.
