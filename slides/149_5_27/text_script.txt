so here's an example my function that calls foo and bar

and i'm starting to adopt this illustration here on the right

which illustrates kind of the stack or the sequence of execution of this thread of control

so in this thread of control there's like part a
the part of my func before the
the call to foo

then there will be the execution of foo
then the execution of bar and then everything after bar
that's just normal c function calls
