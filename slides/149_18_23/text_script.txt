these days
if you want this high bandwidth memory
^.

this is your cpu or gpu 
^386 x 60 @ (1648, 763).

and it's right on a silicon chip
right it's on a silicon chip and on that same silicon chip 
^1315 x 68 @ (721, 840).

is a memory module right into it
^728 x 57 @ (872, 763). 

so now the connections between these two 
^728 x 57 @ (872, 763).
^386 x 60 @ (1648, 763).

are actually wires on a piece of silicon
they're not board traces
okay
^1315 x 68 @ (721, 840).

and then the dram chip is actually stacked
which means that these dram chips are on top of each other physically
^673 x 281 @ (900, 463).

and the key technology was this thing called the ts via
through silicon via
^194 x 40 @ (1193, 460).

so you can think about the wires that used to be like eight wires at the edge of the chip 
^.

are now wires that leave the chip throughout the dram array
^112 x 344 @ (1193, 460).

so you kind of get area amount of space and not one edge of the chip amount of space 
^.

so you can run a lot more wires right off the bottom of the chip
like from everywhere in that array
and those wires have to run through the dram chips below it
^112 x 344 @ (1193, 460).

so there's these vertical wires
^112 x 344 @ (1193, 460).

that then go right into a piece of silicon
^1315 x 68 @ (721, 840).

right over to the gpu
^386 x 60 @ (1648, 763).
