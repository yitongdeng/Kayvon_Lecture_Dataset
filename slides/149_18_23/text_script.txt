these days
if you want this high bandwidth memory
this is your cpu or gpu and it's right on a silicon chip

right it's on a silicon chip and on that same silicon chip is a memory module right into it so now the connections between these two are actually wires on a piece of silicon
they're not board traces
okay
and then the dram chip is actually stacked
which means that these dram chips are on top of each other physically

and the key technology was this thing called the ts via
through silicon via

so you can think about the wires that used to be like eight wires at the edge of the chip are now wires that leave the chip throughout the dram array
so you kind of get area amount of space and not one edge of the chip amount of space so you can run a lot more wires right off the bottom of the chip
like from everywhere in that array

and those wires have to run through the dram chips below it

so there's these vertical wires that then go right into a piece of silicon
right over to the gpu
