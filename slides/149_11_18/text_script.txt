so in hadoop
this is the case
they're doing logistic regression
which is a very simple ml operation
^82 x 173 @ (495, 458).

and k means
which you're very familiar with because of course you've played with that
^.

so we see that hadoop
the first iteration is 80 seconds 
^36 x 133 @ (496, 458).

and subsequent iterations don't get much faster
^35 x 130 @ (537, 461).

of course each iteration requires an hdfs read and an hdfs write
^.

the hadoop binary memory basically keeps a binary memory copy instead of a text copy
^.

and so it's slightly faster on the second iteration
^82 x 173 @ (495, 458).

but still has to access the disk
^.

then spark only has to do the hdfs read
doesn't do the write just write straight to memory
and so subsequent iterations are much faster
^75 x 138 @ (733, 495).
