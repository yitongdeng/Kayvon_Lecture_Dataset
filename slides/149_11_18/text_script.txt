so in hadoop
this is the case
they're doing logistic regression
which is a very simple ml operation

and k means
which you're very familiar with because of course you've played with that

so we see that hadoop

the first iteration is 80 seconds and subsequent iterations don't get much faster

of course each iteration requires an hdfs read and an hdfs write

the hadoop binary memory basically keeps a binary memory copy instead of a text copy
and so it's slightly faster on the second iteration
but still has to access the disk

then spark only has to do the hdfs read
doesn't do the write just write straight to memory
and so subsequent iterations are much faster
