another analogy here is imagine you had two pipes
and if we ignore the actual physics reason that if i push more water down one pipe it speeds up and they rate match 
^.

but let's say that i had one pipe that could do 100 liters a second before it burst
^1100 x 562 @ (91, 261).

and another pipe that could do 50 liters per second before it burst 
^862 x 437 @ (1198, 261).

and i connect them together 
^.

i'm only getting 50 liters per second out of the system
^259 x 50 @ (931, 1022).

i'm going to run at the lower of the throughputs when i link things together
okay
all right
^.
