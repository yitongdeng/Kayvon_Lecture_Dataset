another analogy here is imagine you had two pipes
and if we ignore the actual physics reason that if i push more water down one pipe it speeds up and they rate match but let's say that i had one pipe that could do 100 liters a second before it burst
and another pipe that could do 50 liters per second before it burst and i connect them together i'm only getting 50 liters per second out of the system

i'm going to run at the lower of the throughputs when i link things together
okay

all right
