so we reminded you that the idea
^.

we talked about a cache line
^1089 x 48 @ (193, 446).

we said there's a data component 
^775 x 48 @ (507, 446).

and the metadata
^317 x 48 @ (191, 446).

and part of the metadata is the tag that indicates the line
the address of the line that is contained in this cache
a particular cache line
^189 x 48 @ (316, 446).

and then the dirty bit indicating that the data has been modified in the cache
^13 x 48 @ (190, 446).

and then the line state which is going to be used in the cache coherence protocol
^110 x 48 @ (203, 446).
