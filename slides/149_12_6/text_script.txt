so we reminded you that the idea

we talked about a cache line
we said there's a data component and the metadata

and part of the metadata is the tag that indicates the line
the address of the line that is contained in this cache

a particular cache line
and then the dirty bit indicating that the data has been modified in the cache
and then the line state which is going to be used in the cache coherence protocol
