i like to think about three pieces of blocks in any modern processor

one of them which i'm always going to color orange throughout this class
is about control
figuring out like it's managing where we are in the instruction stream and figuring out
once i get the next instruction
what do i do

then i have this yellow box which is responsible for the arithmetic
maybe adding some numbers or carrying out a move or multiplying some numbers and i'm always going to call that yellow 

and then i have stuff that's blue that's state
and i'm calling this the execution context
it's the context in which we run a program
which is just a big set of values

of bindings from register one has this value

register two has this value

as well as memory has all these values
