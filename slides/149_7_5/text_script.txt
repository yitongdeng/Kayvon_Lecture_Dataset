so the goal of an original gpu design was to solve one specific problem
and that one specific problem was
^.

given some mathematical description of a scene
and that mathematical description was kind of 
^.

the geometry of surfaces
^679 x 396 @ (319, 312).

the location of lights
^.

the position of some fake virtual camera
^.

perform a simulation
simulate the bouncing of light in the scene 
simulate all these materials
^.

and give me a picture of what i would have seen if that was a real camera at that location
^615 x 462 @ (1131, 259).

that was the goal of a graphics chip
^.
