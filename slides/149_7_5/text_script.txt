so the goal of an original gpu design was to solve one specific problem

and that one specific problem was

given some mathematical description of a scene

and that mathematical description was kind of the geometry of surfaces
the location of lights
the position of some fake virtual camera

perform a simulation

simulate the bouncing of light in the scene simulate all these materials

and give me a picture of what i would have seen if that was a real camera at that location

that was the goal of a graphics chip
