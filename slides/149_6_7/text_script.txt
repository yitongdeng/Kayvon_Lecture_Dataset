and this was one of the first mainstream multi threaded chips
so it had
in this case

uh eight cores
uh and each of those cores had a bunch of threads but all of those cores were connected out to to the main memories
uh via what's a cro percent a crossbar switch the ccx is crossbar
and a crossbar means that every core is actually like physically wired to every other one it's like n squared wires for n n n cores and what's kind of interesting is if you look at the chip diagram the actual area
the footprint of a a processor core is about the same as the footprint of the network

so like this these networks that get high bandwidth connection between all the processors are extremely expensive and extremely complex
