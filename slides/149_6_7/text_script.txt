and this was one of the first mainstream multi threaded chips
^873 x 738 @ (136, 279).

so it had
in this case
uh eight cores
uh and each of those cores had a bunch of threads
^85 x 734 @ (1093, 297). 

but all of those cores were connected out to to the main memories
^126 x 588 @ (1710, 369).

uh via what's a cross bar a crossbar switch the ccx is crossbar
^126 x 528 @ (1298, 400).
^225 x 76 @ (451, 591).

and a crossbar means that every core is actually like physically wired to every other one it's like n squared wires for n n n cores 
^.

and what's kind of interesting is if you look at the chip diagram the actual area
the footprint of a a processor core 
^107 x 196 @ (349, 760).

is about the same as the footprint of the network
^225 x 76 @ (451, 591).

so like this these networks that get high bandwidth connection between all the processors are extremely expensive and extremely complex
^225 x 76 @ (451, 591).
