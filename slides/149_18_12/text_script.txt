or you go on amazon or newegg
you buy yourself a dram dimm

so the dimm is
you know imm is the inline memory module
there's just eight of these dram chips sitting there so this is now a 64 bit memory bus
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

so your intel processor
your standard processor connected to a 64 bit memory bus
the memory controller is sending a command

and that command is not
i want address x

but that command is
i want the byte at bank b row r column
whatever

and all eight dram chips get that same command
they all return their data in bank b row r column
zero
and that all together is eight bytes of data

so it's the memory controller's responsibility to say oh if i'm supposed to get a 64 byte cache line at this address

where in this 3d address space of bank rows and columns is that data

and you issue the request
