here's a bus and the bus made a little bit wider turn than it should have

or you could argue that this car probably ignored a little something on the road that says
please don't pass this line
because buses need to turn here
and all of a sudden the bus can't make progress
because that car is there

the car can't make progress
because the bus is there
