but if you look at a lot of the long term ones
they kind of go on some axis
^.

right like if you're a web developer
^.

you might write a lot of code in javascript
you can write whatever you want in javascript
^78 x 87 @ (956, 997).

but you can hack some stuff up pretty quick
and you can hack basically whatever you want but it's not going to be that fast
^.

or if you're writing here
^.

in cpp
^133 x 132 @ (1180, 535).

or rust 
^118 x 114 @ (1254, 709).

and i'll even put java
^75 x 112 @ (1361, 545). 

and cuda in this category
^129 x 68 @ (1443, 681).

these are all different levels of performance to be honest
but you can write whatever you want again
^.

and you'd choose to use c or cpp
so that would be your thing like
^133 x 132 @ (1180, 535).

this needs to be fast i'm going to write it in c
^133 x 132 @ (1180, 535).

or it needs to be gpu accelerated
i'm going to write it in cuda
^129 x 68 @ (1443, 681).
