but if you look at a lot of the long term ones
they kind of go on some axis
right like if you're a web developer
you might write a lot of code in javascript
you can write whatever you want in javascript
but you can hack some stuff up pretty quick
and you can hack basically whatever you want but it's not going to be that fast

or if you're writing here in c or rust and i'll even put java and cuda in this category
these are all different levels of performance to be honest
but you can write whatever you want again
and you'd choose to use c or c
so that would be your thing like this needs to be fast i'm going to write it in c or it needs to be gpu accelerated
i'm going to write it in cuda
