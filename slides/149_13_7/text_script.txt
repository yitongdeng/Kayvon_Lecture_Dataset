of course the reason why i'm telling you all this is this can obviously happen in computing systems like a simple example might be
imagine we had thread a and thread b
and thread a pulls data out of some work queue and puts results in some output work queue

and thread b supposed to pull data out of this work queue and put the data back in the one on the top

so you might be in the case where thread a says well i'm not going to pull any new work because i have nowhere to put my output

so thread a doesn't drain its input

and it's waiting on b but b can't make any progress because there's nowhere for b to put its output

so that's an example
