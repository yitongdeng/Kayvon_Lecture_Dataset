so here again this is that iphone
and now i'm highlighting some of the stuff down here
^.

on this processor
there are six cpus
^454 x 311 @ (362, 553).

two of which are big cpu cores that are supposedly good at running single threads
^244 x 126 @ (362, 738).

there are four small cpu cores that are lower power and good for background stuff
^178 x 184 @ (598, 555).

and then there's a whole bunch of stuff on there for camera
neural networks
sensing 
your heart monitor
all this other stuff that's never even run on the cpu
it's run on specialized processing
^223 x 202 @ (393, 860).
