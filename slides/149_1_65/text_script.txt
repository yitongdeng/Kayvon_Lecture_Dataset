so here again this is that iphone
and now i'm highlighting some of the stuff down here

on this processor
there are six cpus

two of which are big cpu cores that are supposedly good at running single threads

there are four small cpu cores that are lower power and good for background stuff and then there's a whole bunch of stuff on there for camera
neural networks

sensing your heart monitor
all this other stuff that's never even run on the cpu
it's run on specialized processing
