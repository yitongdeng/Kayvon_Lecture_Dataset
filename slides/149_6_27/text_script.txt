so now hopefully you get like a little bit of a sense of 
^.

where all this memory latency comes from
^644 x 112 @ (705, 709).

right like it's an l1 cache lookup 
^34 x 112 @ (744, 709).

an l2 cache lookup
^60 x 112 @ (779, 709).

maybe you actually have a tlb miss because of you know in operating systems or something like that
^.

um maybe you like 
a request a message has to get sent to memory saying
i want the data at this address
^239 x 112 @ (841, 709). 

and at some point the memory starts sending you the data back
^268 x 112 @ (1079, 709).

and if you have a bandwidth of b bits per second you start getting b bits per second back in that blue region
^268 x 112 @ (1079, 709).
