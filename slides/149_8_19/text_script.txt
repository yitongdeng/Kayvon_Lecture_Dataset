and so in the spirit of doing the simplest thing first
if you gave me two threads and said compute a scan
i would probably do something like this
^.

i would divide the array in half
i would do two sequential scans
^739 x 109 @ (298, 353).
^739 x 110 @ (1100, 351).

which is o of n
running straight through memory
^.

i would get the base for the first half
^265 x 39 @ (305, 499).

and then i would parallelize the application of the base to the second half of the array
^741 x 114 @ (296, 604).
^741 x 114 @ (1098, 602).

if we're on a shared memory multiprocessor
the fact that information computed by p2 has to get over to p1 is not that big of a deal 
i'm just reading from the same memory system
