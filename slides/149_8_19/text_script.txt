and so in the spirit of doing the simplest thing first
if you gave me two threads and said compute a scan
i would probably do something like this

i would divide the array in half
i would do two sequential scans

which is o of n

running straight through memory
i would get the base for the first half
and then i would parallelize the application of the base to the second half of the array

if we're on a shared memory multiprocessor
the fact that information computed by p2 has to get over to p1 is not that big of a deal i'm just reading from the same memory system
