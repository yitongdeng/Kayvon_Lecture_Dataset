so it's got three levels of cache

l1 data cache

which is 32 kilobytes in size

an l2 cache

which is per core

so four cores

the data cache is private per core
the l2 cache is private per core

then there's a ring interconnect

which is as you might expect is a ring

that connects all of the different l2 caches together
and they connect to a shared l3 cache

which is eight megabytes in size
