but now
let's think a little bit about what it would take to either specify or program a accelerator where you get to specify a bunch of things that you don't get to control if you're thinking about a general purpose environment
in particular
you get to have some custom memory system
right a lot of the performance improvement you can get in any particular piece of hardware has to do with how you organize the memory to exploit the particular characteristics of locality and access behavior that you see in your application

and you get specialized compute that matches what you need in your application
right so the question is
how do we think about or how do we program specialized processes or accelerators
right
