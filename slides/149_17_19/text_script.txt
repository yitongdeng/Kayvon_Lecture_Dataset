but now
let's think a little bit about what it would take to either 
^.

specify or program a accelerator where you get to specify a bunch of things that you don't get to control
^481 x 605 @ (899, 306).

if you're thinking about a general purpose environment
^816 x 605 @ (51, 309).

in particular
you get to have some custom memory system
right 
^281 x 62 @ (993, 476).
^282 x 61 @ (1006, 825).

a lot of the performance improvement you can get in any particular piece of hardware has to do with how you organize the memory
^281 x 62 @ (993, 476).
^282 x 61 @ (1006, 825).

to exploit the particular characteristics of locality and access behavior that you see in your application
^.

and you get specialized compute that matches what you need in your application
right 
^374 x 69 @ (961, 730).

so the question is
how do we think about or 
^.

how do we program specialized processes or accelerators
right
^481 x 605 @ (899, 306).
