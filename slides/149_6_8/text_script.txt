another example of it is if you just go out and buy a motherboard that has two sockets in it for two physical cpus

you know let's say there's two different four core cpus

there's an on chip network
that ring connecting the cores
the one i showed you and then there are traces out over the dual socket board

and a load or a store from core 1 to address x in that diagram might be a lot faster
or a good bit faster than a load and store from let's say
core 8 to address x
regardless of the caching behavior or things like that
