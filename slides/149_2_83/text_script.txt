it might look something like this
^.

it's got two core it's got two threads
intel likes to call these hyper threads that it can draw from 
^337 x 147 @ (872, 696).

and it has at least three eight wide vector alus
^817 x 68 @ (961, 560).

and a bunch of scalar
you know i plus one stuff that it can do 
^514 x 82 @ (357, 546).

so in every clock
this chip is going
i can utilize up to three vector operations per clock from these alus
^817 x 68 @ (961, 560).

from those two threads
^337 x 147 @ (872, 696).

so in some sense it can find a mul add it can find another mul add it can find another mul add
^817 x 68 @ (961, 560).
