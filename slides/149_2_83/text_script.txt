it might look something like this

it's got two percent it's got two threads
intel likes to call these hyper threads that it can draw from and it has at least three eight wide vector alus
and a bunch of scalar
you know i plus one stuff that it can do so in every clock
this chip is going

i can utilize up to three vector operations per clock from these alus

from those two threads

so in some sense it can find a mole add it can find another mole add it can find another mole add
