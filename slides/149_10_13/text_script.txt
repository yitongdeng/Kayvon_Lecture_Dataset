and a common way to visualize this stuff is think about these n dimensional tensors
so imagine you had an input image that's width by height
so it's width by height by 1

and then imagine i have all of these different filters that are just like you know like i just showed you 3 by 3 matrix of values and stuff like that so there i have these 3 by 3 filters and if i'm gonna do num filters of them i'm gonna percent i'm just percent just for convenience i'm gonna stack them together in a tensor so it's 3 by 3 by number of these filters

and so if i do num filters convolutions of this
i should get width by height by num filters amount of output
