and a common way to visualize this stuff is think about these n dimensional tensors
^.

so imagine you had an input image that's width by height
so it's width by height by 1
^273 x 640 @ (587, 227).

and then imagine i have all of these different filters 
that are just like you know like i just showed you 3 by 3 matrix of values and stuff like that 
^311 x 227 @ (824, 399).

so there i have these 3 by 3 filters and if i'm gonna do num filters of them i'm gonna em i'm just em just for convenience i'm gonna stack them together in a tensor so it's 3 by 3 by number of these filters
^311 x 227 @ (824, 399).

and so if i do
^.

num filters convolutions 
^311 x 227 @ (824, 399).

of this
^273 x 640 @ (587, 227).

i should get width by height by num filters amount of output
^237 x 618 @ (1213, 238).
