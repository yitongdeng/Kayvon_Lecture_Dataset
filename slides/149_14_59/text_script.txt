we're gonna pre process the dependencies
so again like the numbers are edges

the letters are vertices
and i said we're gonna analyze that and we're gonna actually look at which edges share the same vertex

and we're gonna encode that in a graph where edge one and edge five have a line
an edge between them
if edge one and edge five in the mesh share a vertex
so you can encode
so one and five have an edge in this graph because one and five both write to c there

and notice that there's no edge between eight and two
so eight and two do not write to the same values
