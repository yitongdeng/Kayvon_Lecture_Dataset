that we do all the time that i like to use in this class is doing your laundry

imagine you have laundry
and you have a washer
a dryer
and yourself
because there's three stages to get your laundry done so i divvied up the road into 100 stages
now i'm divvying up laundry into three stages
you wash
you dry
and you fold

so if you had one load of laundry
how long would it take you to finish

bottom of the slide
two hours right because it takes 45 minutes plus 60
plus 15 to fold your clothes
