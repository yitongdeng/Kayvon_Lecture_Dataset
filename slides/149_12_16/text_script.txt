for instance
the i7 that's used in your myth machines
so you've got a ring interconnect

and the ring interconnect is not a broadcast interconnect
and so snooping won't work here
and it's also
of course more scalable

but what we have is we have a directory associated with the l3 cache

for this to work

we have to guarantee that every cache line that could be in any of the l2s will also be in l3
this property is called inclusion
