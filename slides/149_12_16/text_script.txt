for instance
the i7 that's used in your myth machines
^.

so you've got a ring interconnect
and the ring interconnect is not a broadcast interconnect
and so snooping won't work here
^547 x 34 @ (158, 499).

and it's also
of course more scalable
^.

but what we have is we have a directory associated with the l3 cache
for this to work
^547 x 89 @ (158, 372).

we have to guarantee that every cache line that could be in any of the l2s
^548 x 89 @ (159, 568).

will also be in l3
^547 x 89 @ (158, 372).

this property is called inclusion
^67 x 16 @ (839, 507).
