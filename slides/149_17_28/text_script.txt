so what do you do if you want to build an accelerator for this
well

remember

you now have to control all the memory
so let's assume that vec1 and vec2 are integer arrays in dram

so it's clear here by this specification of dram
that these two arrays are going to live in dram

now we haven't said exactly how dram works but let's assume that we have a way of moving data between the dram and the accelerator using direct memory access which is an efficient way of moving data between the main memory and the accelerator

and so
we have an excel block
which is where we are going to do the acceleration
