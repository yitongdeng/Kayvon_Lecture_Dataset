but now think about this one

imagine a piece of code where i launched two thread blocks

and one of them says

okay
update this variable in memory

and then the other thread block says
wait until that variable is updated

so one thread block says
i did something
the other thread block waits for it

imagine running this code on a process on a gpu that only can run one thread block at a time

if it runs thread block one first
thread block zero never gets to go
and thread block one is waiting all the time
