and then we're just going to repeat this process over and over and over
^.

producing a bunch of filters
^279 x 239 @ (423, 410).

taking it through that function f
which is setting everything to clamping at zero
^77 x 42 @ (1031, 569).

and then maybe actually doing a few other calculations
^.

like in this case a max pool is largely just a down sample
^152 x 109 @ (1433, 573).

and so on and so on
^.
