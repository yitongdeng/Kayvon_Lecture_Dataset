well if i take your strategy

then what happens is the front part of this program now goes to time n squared over p
and i haven't touched the back half of the program

what's my speed up

perfectly paralyzed the first part of the program
didn't touch the back half but my speed up is what

in the limit let's say is n is huge

sorry
it's twice right so like what is my overall performance
well it used to be 2n squared

and now it's n squared over p plus n squared
and in the limit
that's going to go to bounded by 2

so half my program remains sequential
there's nothing i can do
i can't be any fancier here
if i went to a million processors
i would still be bounded by 2
