so you have all of these different bits
and they're organized on a dram chip actually in this 2d manner

now down here at the bottom of the chip
there's two important structural pieces

first of all you have your wires
your data pins
that actually connect this chip to the rest of the computer
so there's eight data pins here
which means this dram chip at any one clock
can only send eight bits of information
there's a 1 or a 0 on each of these wires

and in order to access the dram chip the dram chip doesn't actually send data from the dram array onto the wires
it actually has a buffer here which is like a digital buffer that stores the values
the bits in one row of the dram chip so this is called the row buffer
so this stores one row
and so when you access data from a dram chip you're actually only accessing data for a bite sized chunk of information stored in this row buffer
