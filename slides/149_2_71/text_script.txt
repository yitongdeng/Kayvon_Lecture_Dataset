so here's my new core
this is a core that in this class i'll use the term hardware multithreaded 
^.

it means the hardware has the ability to run two different instruction streams
or has the ability to maintain state for two different instruction streams
^571 x 219 @ (792, 717).

but this core
as i've drawn it 
can only run one instruction per clock
and in this case i've actually redrawn it to be a scalar instruction
you can see from the diagram
^243 x 93 @ (951, 604).

so single core processor
^.

multithreaded core
^571 x 219 @ (792, 717).

can run one scalar instruction per clock from one of the threads
^243 x 93 @ (951, 604).
