so here's my new core

this is a core that in this class i'll use the term hardware multithreaded it means the hardware has the ability to run two different instruction streams
or has the ability to maintain state for two different instruction streams
but this core
as i've drawn it can only run one instruction per clock
and in this case i've actually redrawn it to be a scalar instruction

you can see from the diagram
so single core processor

multithreaded core
can run one scalar instruction per clock from one of the threads
