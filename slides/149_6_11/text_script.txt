but the name of the game is i have two different computers or two different threads
^.

and each thread
keyword now
works in its own address space
^380 x 451 @ (411, 597).
^378 x 450 @ (1546, 578).

so address x in thread 1's address space 
^99 x 85 @ (451, 707).

is not the same address as address x in thread 2's address space 
they are different address spaces
^.

the only way to exchange information
like every thread can load and store the variables in its own address space 
^.

but the only way to exchange information across these threads is to explicitly send a message
^485 x 203 @ (616, 745).

so in this case
rather than an http request
i said
look let's just abstractly say
^.

thread 1 is going to send the contents 
^485 x 203 @ (616, 745).

of its address x 
^99 x 85 @ (451, 707).

to thread 2 and tag the message with an id so that the receiver on the other side knows what it's getting
^485 x 203 @ (616, 745).

correspondingly
thread 2 is going to post a receive which says
i want to receive the message with this id from thread 1
^534 x 165 @ (1166, 832).

and when we get the data we're going to put that data 
^.

and store it as the contents of the address y in my own address space
^98 x 81 @ (1764, 873).
