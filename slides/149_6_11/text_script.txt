but the name of the game is i have two different computers or two different threads

and each thread
keyword now

works in its own address space

so address x in thread 1's address space is not the same address as address x in thread 2's address space they are different address spaces
the only way to exchange information
like every thread can load and store the variables in its own address space but the only way to exchange information across these threads is to explicitly send a message

so in this case
rather than an http request
i said
look let's just abstractly say
thread 1 is going to send the contents of its address x to thread 2 and tag the message with an id so that the receiver on the other side knows what it's getting

correspondingly
thread 2 is going to post
a receive which says
i want to receive the message with this id from thread 1
and when we get the data
we're going to put that data and store it as the contents of the address y in my own address space
