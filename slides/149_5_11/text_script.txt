so conceptually this is kind of like i have all this work

i threw all the work in a shared work queue
and i have a bunch of percent of percent of worker threads going to the queue and say pop me the next one
pop me the next one now in this case i have a very efficient implementation of that queue because i know all my data is stored in percent in this array already
