so conceptually this is kind of like 
^.

i have all this work
^808 x 149 @ (828, 259).

i threw all the work in a shared work queue
^114 x 319 @ (1172, 509).

and i have a bunch of em of em of worker threads going to the queue and say 
pop me the next one
pop me the next one 
^423 x 75 @ (1011, 930).

now in this case i have a very efficient implementation of that queue because i know all my data is stored in the in this array already
