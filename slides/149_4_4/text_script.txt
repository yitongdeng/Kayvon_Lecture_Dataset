the process you can think of is like
what is step one
^.

step one is almost always figure out what is independent
divide work
figure out what are the things that i could do in parallel if i want to
and terminology is kind of weird
but decomposition is kind of something that i think i use to say that it's like i got a problem
i need to decompose it into things to do
sometimes people might say tasks or something like that
^1084 x 193 @ (329, 274).

and then there's the problem of assigning those tasks
assigning that work
really what i should say
to things that can execute the work
and so you'll often hear me say assignment to mean that
^1134 x 152 @ (305, 499).

so decomposition is going
oh we can work in parallel
^1084 x 193 @ (329, 274).

and assignment is like
okay i'll do this and you do that
^1134 x 152 @ (305, 499).

and then
of course at some point there's often some orchestration 
or some synchronization because we have to sync up 
we might have to compute a total sum 
or it might need to be like
when you're done i'll go
you'll see me call that orchestration
^1158 x 198 @ (305, 676).

and last
there's often a notion of mapping
how does some worker actually get to hardware
^907 x 304 @ (309, 883).
