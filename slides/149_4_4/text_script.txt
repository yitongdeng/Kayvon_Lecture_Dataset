the process you can think of is like
what is step one

step one is almost always figure out what is independent

divide work
figure out what are the things that i could do in parallel if i want to

and terminology is kind of weird
but decomposition is kind of something that i think i use to say that it's like i got a problem
i need to decompose it into things to do

sometimes people might say tasks or something like that
and then there's the problem of assigning those tasks

assigning that work
really what i should say

to things that can execute the work

and so you'll often hear me say assignment to mean that
so decomposition is going
oh we can work in parallel

and assignment is like
okay i'll do this and you do that

and then
of course at some point there's often some orchestration or some synchronization because we have to sync up we might have to compute a total sum or it might need to be like
when you're done i'll go

you'll see me call that orchestration

and last
there's often a notion of mapping

how does some worker actually get to the
