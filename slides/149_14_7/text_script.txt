i can get the same result by actually just blurring 1d convolution across all the rows

so every pixel is the average of the three left and right neighbor in itself

and then i take that result and i blur vertically

and if you think about it after the horizontal blur
i've added up three numbers and then after the vertical blur
i've taken those partial sums and added three of them together so i'm doing the exact same math
