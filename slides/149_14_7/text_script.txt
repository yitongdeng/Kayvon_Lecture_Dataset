i can get the same result by actually just 
^.

blurring 1d convolution across all the rows
^944 x 514 @ (354, 384).

so every pixel is the average of the three left and right neighbor in itself
^.

and then i take that result and i blur vertically
^944 x 514 @ (839, 384).

and if you think about it after the horizontal blur
i've added up three numbers
^457 x 514 @ (839, 384).

and then after the vertical blur
i've taken those partial sums and added three of them together
^457 x 514 @ (1323, 384).

so i'm doing the exact same math
^.
