i have organized my code

instead of just saying launch 72 threads

i have said launch a certain number of thread blocks
and each block is a 4x3 grid of threads
so the thread id is two dimensional
those are these numbers

the block dims are not on this slide but the block dim is 4x3 and then the block index is whatever the current block is
