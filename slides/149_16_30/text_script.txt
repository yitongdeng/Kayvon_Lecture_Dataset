and you see that a lot of the time
^.

the white and the black portions of the stack bar chart are due to 
^106 x 34 @ (531, 434).
^77 x 107 @ (840, 440).

the stm write
which is black
^105 x 15 @ (532, 434).
^84 x 7 @ (836, 437).

and the stm read
which is white
^105 x 16 @ (531, 454).
^77 x 101 @ (840, 446).

so the stm barriers add a lot of overhead
^106 x 34 @ (531, 434).
^77 x 107 @ (840, 440).

and committing also adds a bunch of overhead
^106 x 56 @ (531, 473).
^81 x 60 @ (837, 550).
